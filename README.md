## 🌟 Introduction

'Hangman Game' breathes new life into the traditional paper and pencil word-guessing game. With its digital makeover, it not only becomes more accessible but also significantly more exciting with various play modes, hints, and time-bound challenges.

## 🎯 Game Objectives

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves decoding a hidden word. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly, so use them wisely! 🕵️‍♂️

## 📏 Game Rules

- **Limited Guesses**: You have only **6 attempts** to uncover the mystery word. Choose each letter wisely!
- **Hints to the Rescue**: Stuck? No problem! Use a hint to reveal a letter or even see the word's definition. But use them sparingly, they're precious!
- **Winning & Losing**: Guess the word within the attempts, you emerge victorious. Fail, and the hangman will be completed.

## 🚀 Game Modes

- **Free Play**: Kick back, relax, and play at your leisure, with no time constraints. Perfect for casual gameplay! 🍹
- **Timed Mode**: Feel the adrenaline rush! ⏰ You have a 15-minute countdown to guess the word correctly. The pressure is on!

## 🔧 Tech Stack

Our game is engineered using the powerful Django Web Framework coupled with the dynamic Streamlit app framework, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience from frontend to hosting.

## 🌐 APIs Used

- **Random Word Generator**: `https://random-word-api.vercel.app/` - Keeps the game fresh with an endless supply of random words.
- **Dictionary API**: `https://dictionaryapi.dev/` - Offers definitions, ensuring the game is not just fun, but also a learning experience.

## ⚙ Setup

Want to host your own version of the game? Easy-peasy!

1. Install Streamlit via pip: `pip install streamlit`
2. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone <GIT-REPO>` 
3. Inside the game folder, execute: `streamlit run <filename.py>` 
Voilà! Your game is now live!

## 💭 Development Reflection

Our journey began with brainstorming and solidifying our tech stack, transitioning smoothly into the development phase. Early on, our team synergy was palpable, with clear communication and cohesive decision-making. However, we faced challenges as external commitments led to communication gaps, resulting in redundant efforts and a temporary loss of project direction.

Realigning our focus, we re-established transparent communication channels, which proved instrumental in resolving lingering bugs and refining our application to its current polished form.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

- **The Power of Communication**: We learned that consistent, clear communication is the bedrock of successful collaboration.
- **Skill Enhancement**: This project was a practical school, enhancing our web development prowess, from mastering API integrations to honing UI/UX design skills.

## 🥂 Conclusion and Future Scope

We began the development process by discussing our tech stack and finalized it early on. 
Then at a later date we began the development of our application. We worked incrementally
and over time a functional application was completed. We believe that our early discussions
worked quite well, we finalized design decisions quite quickly and with little disagreement.
During the time in which we were communicating clearly, and often we had little issues or 
confusion. However, later in the design process we all got quite busy with other projects 
and had a few lapses in communication which resulted in some confusion. There was work being
done more than once or being made obsolete. At one point a new repository was created which 
caused some minor confusion at certain points. This caused some issues in the design process 
as we did not communicate effectively on what was being done or was in the works. After this 
period of confusion we began more clear communication and continued on to create a functional 
application. We think that this period of communication was quite effective, and we were able 
to work out bugs and complete the application with few further issues. There were a number of 
lessons learned here such as the importance of proper communication within a team. We had a few 
issues with communication and all agree that had we communicated more clearly and more often we 
could have avoided several of the main issues that we faced. We also learned many skills relating 
to web development. While we all had some prior experience none of us are experts in web development, 
and thus we had to learn many skills within the scope of this project such as utilizing apis, 
UI/UX development, and more. This allowed us to all grow as developers and to further hone our skills 
in web development. Overall we feel that this project went reasonably well and that we created a well-made, 
functional project. While we had some minor communication issues we worked through them and were able to 
increase our skills not just as developers but as team members. These experiences will allow us to be 
significantly more effective as software developers in the future and will be greatly beneficial in 
future endeavors.  

The adventure doesn't end here, though! We're excited about potential future enhancements, from integrating more complex word puzzles to introducing competitive multiplayer modes. The possibilities are endless, and we look forward to continuing this journey!
