                    **Hangman** is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, 
                    and the others try to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
                    - Click "Start" to begin the game.
                    - You will be given a word to guess, represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word.
                    - You guess by suggesting a letter, which you believe may be a part of the word.
                    - If the word contains the suggested letter, the computer fills in the blanks with that letter in the right position.
                    - If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the computer draws one element of a hangmanâ€™s gallows.
                    - The game is over either when the player guesses the complete word, or the hangman's body is fully drawn.
